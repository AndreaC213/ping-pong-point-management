# ping-pong-point-management

Smarttwigs Application Exercise

We have a super competitive internal ping pong league. We’ve been trying to keep score of our wins, losses and points but we keep losing track. As programmers we decide to build a ping pong point manager that allows you and your opponent to register their name or choose a previously registered name and who will serve to start a game, in order to manage wins(points) per round.

The ping pong game will follow the 10 point system, where a player wins when he exceeds 10 points. If both players reach 10 points, the players need to win by 2 points to win. Serving switches every 2 points. The app should denote who’s serving.


The point management system will allow the players to update their points per round and the point management system will also denote the server per round. The point management system will also announce the winner and update the players position on the leader board

The leaderboard should be visible at some point in the flow.

At any point the players should be able to terminate the game with no winner selected.

Bonus:
Players can continue game option, if two players who had an unfinished game start playing again
Players can choose 10 or 20 (serve every 5) game type
One player can only play one game at a time
